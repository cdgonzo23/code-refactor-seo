# code-refactor-seo

## Description

The goal of this project was to make the code to be more accessibility friendly and to have better search engine optimization. I replaced the div tags to be more semantic tags such as main, section, aside. I consolidated the repetitive css selectors into specific class selectors. I added alt image tags to be more accesible to those using screen readers. I also fixed the dead link and I changed the title to be more specific. In this project I learned to be detailed about the alt image tags, I learned how to create a link within a page, I learned about efficiancy in css selectors, and I learned the importance of using semantic html elements.
